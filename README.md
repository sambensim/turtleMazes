# turtleMazes
Python scripts to generate mazes using Depth-First and Turtles and solve them with A* Pathfinding
### Generating
> All my knowledge on this topic comes from [Reducible's Amazing Depth First Search Video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PMMc4VsIacU)
### Solving
> I found the [explanation from RedBlobGames](https://www.redblobgames.com/pathfinding/a-star/introduction.html) to be the most useful for me in my understanding of A*
### Drawing
Nothing too complicated here, originally used commands from turtle's perspective, but it was more concise and easier to just change the turtle's x/y coordinates
